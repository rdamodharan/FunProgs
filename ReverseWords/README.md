# Problem of the Week

This is an attempt to solve the problem given in http://codingforinterviews.com/ for week of Apr 10.

Write a function which, given a sentence like this:

> Coding for Interviews contains too many gifs.

Returns the sentence with the order of the words reversed, like so:

> gifs. many too contains Interviews for Coding

The catch is: your function should use O(1) space. What is your algorithm's time complexity?
